Donut is an **experimental** data versioning system that allows data to be shared  while keeping track of it's changes. Reducing data
duplication and bringing decentralization to the data versioning solutions.

# Doctrines

What values guide the design & development of the system?

+ **Efficency is King.** Gotta make the most of the CPU resources available through SIMD (i.e. AVX, SSE)
+ **Performance is Queen.** Algorithms and processes need to be fast so that waiting times are minimized
+ **Close to the metal.** The hardware is the platform. Hence, the speed at which the hardware can go is the only limitation
+ **Portability.** Need to be POSIX compliant, so that it can be used in different platforms

# Features

What Donut is meant to achieve?

+ Support for several data formats
+ Switch between data versions quickly
+ Trackable data transformation history
+ Sane data sharing and versioning
